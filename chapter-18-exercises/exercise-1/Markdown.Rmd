## This is my report!

I like writing **reports**

```{r example, include = FALSE}
numbers <- runif(1:100)
hist(numbers)
numbers_mean <- mean(numbers) # get the mean
img_url <- "![puppies
](url goes here)"
```

The mean of the numbers happens to be **`r numbers_mean`**.

```{r other_chunck}
print("Hello World!")
```
